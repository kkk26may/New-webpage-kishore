                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Ice formation on surfaces occurs when supercooled water droplet hits the surface, where it loses energy and form ordered ice structures. To prevent ice formation, researchers have been studying ways to develop materials that display a passive anti-icing property, which repels the formation of ice on the surface. This involves a fundamental understanding of the interaction between ice and surfaces, which has been studied using molecular dynamics simulations. In this study, nano-spherical water droplets are used to investigate the hydrophobicity of various surfaces such as silicon, silicon oxide, graphene, titanium oxide and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The effects of surface roughness on contact angle and hydrophobicity are also analyzed. The goal is to achieve super-hydrophobicity, and use these materials as coating materials on the base surface, which is a highly desirable property for anti-icing materials. The knowledge gained from these studies is being applied to the development of a hybrid molecular dynamics-computational fluid dynamics (MD-CFD) solver. This solver will be used to efficiently handle ice behavior on aircraft surfaces and other applications in the aviation industry, power transmission, and wind turbines. The goal is to develop materials that can withstand harsh weather conditions and reduce the risks associated with ice formation on surfaces.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Studies on rocket motors have demonstrated that combustion efficiency enhances with the addition of aluminum nano particles, which can significantly boost motor performance. However, agglomeration of aluminum particles reduces combustion efficiency, which is countered by coating them with thin layers of nickel atoms. With the aim to understand the sintering and coating process from molecular perspective, molecular dynamics simulations were employed to study nickel and aluminum nano particles. It was observed that nickel and aluminum nanoparticles, when placed in close proximity, they coalesce into a single spherical nickel aluminide particle by releasing substantial amounts of energy. Additionally, shell sintering was examined by coating nickel with aluminum, revealing that the stability of the shell is dependent on the thickness of the nickel coating. Moreover, the critical thickness of the coating is found to hinder the sintering process. </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Nano-scale water pumping through carbon nanotubes is an area of active research due to the need for efficient fluid transportation at the nanoscale level. Molecular dynamics simulations are commonly used to study the behavior of fluids flowing through carbon nanotubes and to understand the underlying physics of the process. In this present study, the use of coaxially rotating carbon nanotubes has been proposed as a novel and energy-efficient mechanism for pumping water through nanodevices.
                        It was observed that the coaxially rotating carbon nanotubes induce fluid flow due to their rotational motion, resulting in significantly higher flow rates when compared to systems that possess only a single chiral rotating carbon nanotube. These studies were carried out for two fluids, water and argon.

                <div class="reseach-content-text">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Sputtering is a process in which high-energy particles collide with a solid surface and eject particles from the surface. In the context of ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor), one of the major challenges is finding a plasma-facing material (PFM) that can withstand the high energy from fusion reactions and the impact of dust particles. To better understand this process, we have used molecular dynamics simulations to study sputtering and crater formation on the PFM surface when subjected to low to high-energy dust particles. The dust particles ranged in size from a few to a thousand atoms, and their impact on the PFM was analyzed to determine the characteristics of the resulting craters. By studying the behavior of dust particles on the surface of different materials, one can identify the most suitable materials for plasma-facing components that can withstand the harsh conditions of fusion reactions.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Designing nano-confined devices and investigating the gas flows in rarefied and micro-scale conditions requires accurate estimation of non-conserved quantities, such as viscous stress and heat flux. In the Knudsen layer region, where gas-wall interaction deviates from the classical Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) formulations, higher-order accurate constitutive relations are necessary to determine the appropriate dynamics. This study aims to examine the deviations occurring in continuum theories and explore flow dynamics in the Knudsen Layer from an atomistic perspective. To achieve this goal, molecular dynamics simulations are conducted on planar and cylindrical Couette flows with both mono-atomic and di-atomic gases at various Knudsen and Mach numbers.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="reseach-content-text">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In recent years, representative volume elements (RVEs) have become a crucial component in the study of nanocomposites, particularly in advanced composite studies where like CNT-Polymer nanocomposites can provide a wide range of properties that are often lacking in polymers, such as improved conductivity and higher tensile strength. To gain a molecular-level understanding of the mechanical response of nanocomposite systems, we must understand the constituents and interactions of the RVEs at a molecular level. To achieve this, we study the constituents of our CNT-PE nanocomposite individually and then evaluate the nanocomposite behavior based on that information. The objective of this research is to validate the use of RVEs in gaining a molecular-level understanding of the mechanical response of nanocomposite systems, using a carbon nanotube (CNT) and polyethylene (PE) nanocomposite as an example. The CNT and PE systems are modelled using the molecular dynamics (MD) method, and the small strain values are validated. Finally, the tensile loading behavior of the nanocomposite is documented at various CNT mass fractions.</p>
